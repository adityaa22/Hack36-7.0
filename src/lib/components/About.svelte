            Our vision is to provide a platform for students to showcase their technical skills and
            creativity. We want to encourage students to think out of the box and come up with
            innovative solutions to real-world problems. We believe that hackathons are a great way
            to learn new technologies and collaborate with like-minded individuals. We want to
            create an environment where students can learn, grow, and have fun.
